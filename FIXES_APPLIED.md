# Key Fixes Applied to Restore Working Functionality

## 🔍 Issues Found by Comparing with Initial Working Version

### 1. **HTTP Method Issue** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Jobs endpoints were using GET method instead of POST
**Fix**: Restored the original logic from working version:
```python
# OLD (Broken):
method = "GET"  # Forced all requests to GET

# NEW (Fixed):
method = "POST" if "/jobs/" in endpoint.url and "status-count" not in endpoint.url else "GET"
```

### 2. **Endpoint URL Parameters** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Added PerPage=10 to all endpoints, which might have caused issues
**Fix**: Removed PerPage parameters to match working version:

```python
# OLD (Broken):
"jobs": APIEndpoint(
    url=f"{self.base_url}/jobs/get-job-list-filter-with-Paginator/?PerPage=10",
    description="Get job listings (10 per page, but shows total count)",
    category="job"
)

# NEW (Fixed):
"jobs": APIEndpoint(
    url=f"{self.base_url}/jobs/get-job-list-filter-with-Paginator/",
    description="Get job listings",
    category="job"
)
```

### 3. **Timeout Values** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Reduced timeout from 30s to 15s
**Fix**: Restored 30-second timeout to match working version

## 🎯 What Should Work Now

### Jobs Functionality:
- ✅ "list all jobs" - Should work with POST method
- ✅ "search for java jobs" - Should work with POST method
- ✅ "how many jobs do we have" - Should work

### Clients Functionality:
- ✅ "list all clients" - Should work with GET method
- ✅ "how many clients" - Should work

### Candidates Functionality:
- ✅ Already working (kept as is)
- ✅ "list all candidates" - Shows 975,952 total
- ✅ "search for java developers" - Works with candidate_search

### Vendors Functionality:
- ✅ "list all vendors" - Should work with GET method

## 🧪 Test These Queries

1. **Jobs:**
   ```
   "list all jobs"
   "search for active jobs"
   "how many jobs do we have"
   ```

2. **Clients:**
   ```
   "list all clients"
   "how many clients"
   ```

3. **Vendors:**
   ```
   "list all vendors"
   "how many vendors"
   ```

## 📊 Expected Terminal Output

For jobs queries, you should now see:
```
📞 Making POST request to: https://dev.oats-backend.otomashen.com/jobs/get-job-list-filter-with-Paginator/
📬 Response status: 200
```

Instead of the previous GET requests that were failing.

## 🔧 JSON Processing Features Kept

All the JSON analysis features are preserved:
- ✅ TotalItems/Count extraction
- ✅ Debug logging for all endpoints
- ✅ Structured data processing
- ✅ LLM formatting with tables
- ✅ JSON API endpoint (/api/query)

The fixes restore the original working functionality while keeping all the new JSON processing improvements!
